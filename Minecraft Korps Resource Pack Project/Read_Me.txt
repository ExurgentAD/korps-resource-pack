Hi!
 
If you are reading this that means you downloaded my KORPS unofficial resource pack project that I was working on for a while.

First of all I would like to thank you for choosing to continue working on this project, if that is what you plan on doing. Otherwise I hope you enjoy the very small sights of what this pack has to offer.

I already changed some items in the game, meaning you can view them and go off of my designs or you can remodel everything to your heart's content.

Included in this package should be every single thing I made related to this pack. Which includes the textures, the alpha photos, what have you.

Whatever you do is up to you, but I'm forfeiting this project.

Folders:

The folder "Korps Font" contains the KORPS font that I managed to port to Minecraft, reverted text and all.

The folder "korpstest" is the resource pack itself, this goes into the "Resource Packs" folder in your world save.

The folder "saves" is the world save itself, it contains containers and some other items. Feel free to load this or try to load this and add whatever you want to it.

The folder "smoothfont" is just a folder containing Minecraft's smooth font assets and some random early progress title screen images.
