This is the file that the resource pack would call if you enable replacing every piece of text with the KORPS .otf file.

It's not perfect, but I believe the text is also reversed so I managed to achieve at least that.

Find the default.json within the normal .pack file and replace (dont forget to backup that file however, you don't want to lose it) that file with this one, and also make sure you include the .otf file with it so the game can read it.
